# Systems Integration & Automation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ **Automation & Scaling Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Quick Wins (2-4 weeks)**

The immediate priority is operationalizing the ICP scoring system within existing infrastructure. We'll import the scored dataset directly into Salesforce as custom fields (ICP_Score**c, ICP_Archetype**c, Priority_Tier\_\_c) and implement score-based lead assignment rules. Critical accounts (90+ scores) automatically route to senior reps, while high-priority accounts (80-89) go to experienced AEs. This provides immediate ROI with minimal technical investment. Simultaneously, we'll create priority-based list views and dashboards for sales managers to monitor pipeline health by ICP tier. The lead scoring methodology will be documented as workflow rules that can be manually applied to new leads while automated systems are developed.

### **Phase 2: Scalable Pipeline Architecture (3-6 months)**

Building for scale requires connecting the ICP engine to marketing automation platforms (Marketo/Pardot) for real-time lead scoring and nurture campaign triggers. We'll implement API integrations with data enrichment providers (ZoomInfo, Clearbit) to automatically fill missing firmographic data, reducing the 19% data gaps identified in our analysis. The scoring algorithm will be rebuilt as a microservice that processes leads in real-time via webhooks from form submissions, CRM updates, and intent data feeds. This creates a continuous feedback loop where lead scores update dynamically as new information becomes available. Marketing campaigns will be automatically triggered based on ICP archetype assignment, delivering personalized content for Enterprise Risk, Mid-Market Compliance, and Board Governance segments. A centralized data warehouse will aggregate prospect data from multiple sources, enabling advanced analytics and machine learning model training for predictive scoring improvements.

## ðŸ”§ **Technology Tradeoffs Analysis**

### **Scripts vs. Pipelines Decision Matrix**

**Current Script Approach (Recommended for Year 1):**

- **Pros:** Fast implementation (2-week setup), low infrastructure cost, easy to modify scoring criteria, immediate business value, minimal IT resources required
- **Cons:** Manual data refresh process, limited scalability, requires periodic re-running, no real-time updates
- **Best For:** Proving ROI, refining ICP criteria, training sales team on new methodology

**Automated Pipeline Approach (Year 2+ Goal):**

- **Pros:** Real-time scoring, infinite scalability, automatic data enrichment, machine learning capability, integration with all systems
- **Cons:** Higher development cost ($50K-$100K), 3-6 month implementation, requires DevOps resources, more complex troubleshooting
- **Best For:** High-volume lead processing, mature GTM operations, enterprise-scale deployment

**Hybrid Recommendation:** Start with scripts for immediate wins while building pipeline infrastructure in parallel. This allows us to capture revenue opportunities now while investing in long-term scalability.

### **System Connections Priority**

1. **Salesforce Integration** (Week 1): Custom fields, workflow rules, assignment automation
2. **Marketing Automation** (Month 2): Marketo/Pardot campaign triggers based on ICP archetype
3. **Data Enrichment** (Month 3): ZoomInfo API for missing firmographic data
4. **Intent Data** (Month 4): Bombora integration for behavioral scoring updates
5. **Customer Data Platform** (Month 6): Unified prospect/customer view across all touchpoints

The architecture prioritizes speed-to-value while building toward a comprehensive, automated GTM engine that scales with business growth and provides competitive advantage through data-driven prospect prioritization.
